## Description

This project allows the user to create a team of employees through the command line. The user is prompted to enter the name, id, email, and role of the employee. Depending on the role, the user will be prompted to enter additional information. The user can add as many employees as they would like.

Use of this starter template assumes that you have a 'complete dev environment' setup - a terminal, Node, VS Code, at least. If not, you may want to [start here.](https://www.notion.so/codefinity/Setting-up-a-Local-Dev-Environment-for-JS-02a4e9f4a30043d3a8e7d109be3448f4)
